**Escalation of commitment** is a human behavior pattern in which an
individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from a
[decision](Decision-making "wikilink"), action, or investment
nevertheless continues the behavior instead of altering course. The
actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous
decisions and actions.

Economists and [behavioral scientists](behavioral_scientists "wikilink")
use a related term, *sunk-cost fallacy*, to describe the justification
of increased [investment](investment "wikilink") of money or effort in a
decision, based on the cumulative prior investment (“[sunk
cost](sunk_cost "wikilink")”) despite new evidence suggesting that the
future cost of continuing the behavior outweighs the expected benefit.

In [sociology](sociology "wikilink"), *irrational escalation of
commitment* or *commitment bias* describe similar behaviors. The
phenomenon and the sentiment underlying them are reflected in such
proverbial images as “throwing good money after bad” or “in for a penny,
in for a pound”, or “It's never the wrong time to make the right
decision.”

Early use
---------

Escalation of commitment was first described by Barry M. Staw in his
1976 paper, “Knee deep in the big muddy: A study of escalating
commitment to a chosen course of action”.

Researchers, inspired by the work of Staw, conducted studies that tested
factors, situations and causes of escalation of commitment. The research
introduced other analyses of situations and how people approach problems
and make decisions. Some of the earliest work stemmed from events in
which this phenomenon had an effect and help explain the phenomenon.

### Researchers define escalation of commitment

Over the past few decades, researchers have followed and analyzed many
examples of the escalation of commitment to a situation. The heightened
situations are explained in three elements. Firstly, a situation has a
costly amount of resources such as time, money and people invested in
the project. Next, past behavior leads up to an apex in time where the
project has not met expectations or could be in a cautious state of
decline. Lastly, these problems all force a decision-maker to make
choices that include the options of continuing to pursue a project until
completion by adding additional costs, or canceling the project
altogether.

Researchers have also developed an argument regarding how escalation of
commitment is observed in two different categories. Many researchers
believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to [expectancy
theory](expectancy_theory "wikilink"). “According to such a viewpoint,
decision makers assess the probability that additional resource
allocations will lead to goal attainment, as well as the value of goal
attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a
subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate
additional resources.” The next phase of the escalation process is
self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made
used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make
positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose
was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to
produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader
that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if
their decision is what others believed in.

Research conducted on the topic has been taken from many other forms and
theories of psychology. Many believe that what researchers have done
thus far to explain this behavior is best analyzed and tested through
situational development and resource allocation.

Other research has identified circumstances that lead to the opposite of
escalation of commitment, namely deescalation of commitment. This
research explains the factors that influence whether escalation or
deescalation of commitment is more likely to occur through the role of
budgeting and mental accounting.

### Vietnam War

Escalation of commitment can many times cause behavior change by means
of locking into resources. One of the first examples of escalation of
commitment was described by [George
Ball](George_Ball_(diplomat) "wikilink"), who wrote to President [Lyndon
Johnson](Lyndon_Johnson "wikilink") to explain to him the predictions of
the war outcome:

Theories
--------

### Self-justification theory

[Self-justification](Self-justification_theory "wikilink") thought
process is a part of commitment decisions of leaders and managers of a
group and can therefore cause a rise in commitment levels. This
attitude provides “one explanation for why people escalate commitment to
their past investments.” Managers make decisions that reflect
previous behavior. Managers tend to recall and follow information that
is aligned to their behavior to create consistency for their current and
future decisions. If a group member or outside party recognizes
inconsistent decision making, this can alter the leadership role of the
manager. Managers have external influence from society, peers, and
authority, which can significantly alter a manager's perception on what
factors realistically matter when making decisions.

### Prospect theory

[Prospect theory](Prospect_theory "wikilink") helps to describe the
natural reactions and processes involved in making a decision in a
risk-taking situation. Prospect theory makes the argument for how levels
of wealth, whether that is people, money, or time, affect how a decision
is made. Researchers were particularly interested in how one perceives a
situation based on costs and benefits. The framing to how the
problem is introduced is crucial for understanding and thinking of the
probability that the situation will either work in favor or against you
and how to prepare for those changes. “Whyte (1986) argued that prospect
theory provides the psychological mechanism by which to explain
escalating commitment to a failing course of action without the need to
invoke self-justification processes. (Fiegenbaum & Thomas, 1988:
99)” Prospect theorists believe that one's use of this process is
when there is a negative downfall in the stakes that will affect the
outcome of the project. To ensure they will not fail, the individual may
add more resources to assure them that they will succeed. Although this
theory seems realistic, researchers “Davis and Bobko (1986) found no
effect of personal responsibility on continued commitment to the
previous course of action in the positive frame condition.” Which
means that escalation of commitment will be lower in the higher
responsibility situation.

### Attribution theory

The [attribution theory](attribution_theory "wikilink"), originating
from [Fritz Heider](Fritz_Heider "wikilink"), “attempts to find causal
explanations for events and human behaviors.” This theory approaches two
methods of inquiry including locus of causality and stability.
Locus of causality reflects on internal characteristics of an
individual, such as intelligence levels and attention seeking, with the
relationship of the external space such as weather forecasts and task
difficulty. Aspects of control become a significant factor in how a
manager justifies a decision made. Managers will use the relationship
between internal and external factors to describe why they made a
decision to a single point of view. Managers may justify their actions
by explaining that this was out of their personal control of the event,
or they could believe that the decision could not be controlled by
anyone else. Research suggests that “the type of attribution made by an
employee across these dimensions is likely to impact an employee's
tendency to engage in the negative emotional activity referred to as
escalation of commitment.”

### Social identity theory

Identity is a large part of how we move through the world. Private
thoughts and opinions as well as the effect of others create the [social
identity theory](social_identity_theory "wikilink"). People make
connections between their use of groups and their own view of
themselves, which researchers have discovered motivates people to keep
their social status and to defend it whenever it is endangered.

### Theoretical models

#### Temporal model of escalation

Groups engage in temporal comparisons, which means that you compare
actions and behaviors at “different points in time.” This is a form
of social identity scenario. This type of comparison can be made when a
decision seems unproductive and forces team members to consider any
threat to the group.

#### Aggregate model

“The aggregate model's emphasis is upon the accumulation and balance of
forces rather than the ordering of effects over time.” The model is
general and can provide an ideal view as to how the effects whether
positive or negative are defined by micro and macro forces. This model
goes by situation rather than what researchers have defined as the norm.
There is no process to follow, which makes it very useful for
researchers because they can understand a situation more clearly as well
as see the bigger picture of the situation.

Determinants
------------

The main drivers of the tendency to continue investing in losing
propositions are project, psychological, social, and structural.

### Project

Project determinants are those that refer to the original commitments
and decisions made at a project's beginning. This includes general
project characteristics and initial financial costs. Among them,
decision risk, opportunity cost information, and information acquisition
have been found to have negative relationships with escalation of
commitment. Decision uncertainty, positive performance trend
information, and expressed preference for initial decision have been
found to have positive relationships.

High costs of ending a project or changing its course, potential
financial gain upon completion, and extensive structure can factor in to
escalation of commitment, making it difficult to walk away from the
project. Preventing future monetary loss, potential savings, and having
clearly available alternatives can allow for avoidance of the behavior.
In studies by Teger and later Ross and Staw, situations where ending an
action costs more than completing it resulted in decision makers being
trapped in their current, costly behaviors.

### Psychological

Psychological determinants are those that refer to internal views on the
actions and information involved in a project. This can include
cognitive factors, personality, and emotions as they relate to project
elements. Of these, sunk costs, time investment, decision maker
experience and expertise, self-efficacy and confidence, personal
responsibility for the initial decision, ego threat, and proximity to
project completion have been found to have positive relationships with
escalation of commitment, while anticipated regret and positive
information framing have been found to have negative relationships.

Optimism and belief that one has control over what will still be
positive outcomes lead to continued self-justification of commitment to
actions. People add to their initial personal investments in the hope
they will overcome currently negative results. This was illustrated in a
case study by Staw, where providing business students with manipulated
responsibilities for initial decisions and their outcomes resulted in
the greatest commitment to increased actions and resources when the
initial decision assigned was made directly by the student with poor
outcomes. In these instances, people take further risk in an
attempt to avoid further problems. This is even more likely when
subjects view current issues as having unstable reasoning rather than
stable reasoning, or when the individual is unwilling to admit
mistakes. They then believe the situation will stabilize or turn
around. [Confirmation bias](Confirmation_bias "wikilink") can also lead
to escalation of commitment as individuals are then less likely to
recognize the negative results of their decisions. On the other
hand, if the results are recognized, they can be blamed on unforeseeable
events occurring during the course of the project.

The effect of sunk costs is often seen escalating commitment. When the
amount of investment is greater and can not be recovered, the desire to
avoid complete loss of those resources and keeping with impression
management prompts continued investment over pulling out.
Relatedly, as invested resources can include time, closeness to
completion of a project yields similar results. More value is placed on
project when they are early or late in their process due to the clarity
of completion goals at those points. It's more likely that risks
will be taken at these points than in a project closer to a visible
midpoint.

### Social

Social determinants are those that refer to the expectations and
influence of other individuals or groups on project actions. Included in
these, group identity or cohesive strength has been found to have the
most influence on escalation of commitment while public evaluation of
decision and resistance to decision from others has little significance
in relation.

#### External justification and binding

Individuals present themselves cautiously to others in the environment.
They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate
and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing
competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that
usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of
action. Managers have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a
group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a
team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are
concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent.
Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy
resistance, job insecurity (Fox & Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin &
Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic
factors are present. This mental and emotional response is referred to
as the face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others
are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and
beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social
identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can
identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or
project. Team members consistently use statements like “that project is
Bob's baby,” or “oh, we had the same idea.” Both ends of the spectrum
are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially
something that failed.

#### Leadership norms

Leaders are responsible for guiding a team through the difficult
problems into a solution. Although many times, the negative aspects of
commitments can be discussed in more detail and importance, there are
many social rewards that are positive. One example of this phenomenon is
persistence. A project on the verge of failure is a manager's
responsibility to revive, but with persistence, a manager can get
rewarded to turning a bad project into something great. Rewards are
earned for turning around a team to produce something successful. When
managers stick to their goals, and get their team to produce
responsibly.

### Structural

Structural determinants are those that refer to the cultural and
environmental features and resources of the project's overall
organization. The minimal research available on them indicates that
agency problems most influence escalation of commitment.

There are macro-level variables that affect the organizational structure
of a team and how they make decisions. Decisions are made based on
individuals in a group setting with specific roles and responsibilities
and effect decisions that are a product of interaction in the team. The
determinant that affects escalation of commitment is institutional
inertia. This phenomenon is used to describe how individual attitudes
and behavior changes frequently, so therefore, a group's stature is also
unpredictable and controllable. “Organizations have very imperfect
sensory systems, making them relatively impervious to changes in their
environments.”

This is one factor that plays a role in how issues are addressed. When
there are a group of individuals involved in communication, decisions,
and change, with the lack of consistency in the group, most of the tasks
fail to complete. This phenomenon occurs in situations such as policy
change, rulings and procedures.

This issue can also cause havoc for an organization when they are too
attached to a policy, thought process or identity because they are not
free to change. “On occasion, a project, product, or policy can become
so closely tied to the values and purposes of the organization that it
becomes almost unthinkable to consider withdrawal.” One primary
example of this phenomenon is the downfall of the [Pan American World
Airways](Pan_American_World_Airways "wikilink") company, commonly known
as Pan Am. Pan Am was a well known airlines and hotel with hundreds of
employees. With the turn of industry, airline policies were deregulated
and caused financial downfall for Pan Am. The company over time made
cuts to their company to stay afloat. The company believed that their
image of being an airline was more important than being a successful
company that they removed all of the assets that were in fact making
them the largest amount of revenue only to save the image they thought
they needed to remain to be Pan Am.

Groups vs individuals
---------------------

In groups, it can be more difficult to attribute issues to a single,
simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes
there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions
misalign. Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to
changing course.

Even if the need to change course or cease action is recognized,
communication speed, policies, and business politics can be
hindrances. A larger organization, especially one with a spread of
subgroups, has to communicate the argument and decision to go against
previous actions across the appropriate levels. If this communication
does not occur in a timely manner or is blocked, the final decision may
not be made and acted upon. A decision that goes against existing rules
and processes may also reach resistance even with support from those
within the organization. Individuals and groups that are directly
employed due to a project, have financial stake in it may provide enough
opposition to prevent changes from being made as well. They feel
personally responsible for the parts they've worked on and can also feel
that they too are being replaced or terminated. Escalation of
commitment can then occur in any of these situations. External groups
can play an even larger part in escalating commitment if their power is
greater than that of the group taking action and they use that power to
directly lead and influence.

With a larger number of decision makers included, groups have the
opportunity for greater productivity than single individuals, but they
also have the opportunity for greater losses and escalation.
Members can eliminate some of the escalation potential if they come to a
better decision earlier on in the process and avoid the need to change
course dramatically. Yet they can also hold onto a larger base of
support for their initial actions to the point where escalation
potential is increased. In this case,
[groupthink](groupthink "wikilink") assists in keeping with the original
decision and pressures towards conformity rather than dividing the group
with other options. Also, a group whose members are not cohesive can
have decreased escalation potential due to conflicts and varying levels
of inclusion in the process.

Organizations that are family businesses are especially prone to
escalation of commitment due to the added level of going through the
family structure in addition to the business structure, allowing for
further conflicts between the two. Business reputation, customer
and share loss, and financial loss become risks.

--------

-   The [dollar auction](dollar_auction "wikilink") is a thought
    exercise demonstrating the concept.
-   After a heated and aggressive bidding war, property developer
    [Robert Campeau](Robert_Campeau "wikilink") ended up buying

    million more than it was worth. The *[Wall Street
    Journal](Wall_Street_Journal "wikilink")* noted that “we're not
